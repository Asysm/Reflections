staging area is a temeperory place to reorganize files from working direcotry before placing them into a repository in a desireable structure.
Place all the files associated with the logial changes into the stagging area. So the commit will include all the related files.
branch would be useful, as the video stated, when different versions of product are necessary for different target customers. Ex, game easy mode vs hard mode; 18+ vs under 18.
Diagram allows me to trace back every commit made within the branch.
